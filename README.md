## Overview
When working with certain technologies or software, you might run into a problem that you need help solving. Instead of asking someone in a slack channel for help, you can post your question on Stack Overflow with specific tags and the channel will be notified of your question. 

The bot aims to **encourage users to ask questions to Stack Overflow** instead of the slack chat, **reduce the clutter inside a slack channel** which is dedicated for team communications, and **prevent duplicate questions** from being asked.

## Features
 * Specify multiple tags per channel.
